Contributions to this repository can be made under the
[GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license),
i.e. that you license your contributions under same license the project

The rest of this file describes general expectations for
contributions, offered in a spirit of saving everyone a bunch of hassle.

## Documentation

There is some documentation collected in the `doc/` directory,
although it is of unknown accuracy at this point. Please update any
appropriate documentation as part of your PR. Feel free to convert
documentation to Markdown.

## Testing and Refactoring

There is a basic unit testing framework in place using the
[Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/) library. Please take
advantage of it in order to refactor _safely_ and to document any
behavioral changes you have made. Please ensure all tests pass on your
PR, even when compiling with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. Continuous
integration is provided by [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/jonm/SillyMUD).

## Code Standards

The code is of varying quality, having been assembled by a number of
authors over the years, so please help us clean it up gradually. The
basics are:
* on supported platforms, MUST NOT generate compiler warnings; you
can check this when you build via
`CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Werror" ./configure"`.
* SHOULD use two spaces for indents, no tabs
* open braces SHOULD be at the end of the prior line, not on a line by
themselves

Existing code has been formatted with:

`gindent -bap -bli0 -l79 -ncs -npcs -lc79 -br -brf -brs -nut -i2
-nce -npsl`

Consider using this to keep your additions stylistically agreeable.


## Pull Requests

As inspired by the [contribution
guidelines](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
from the [Sirius](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius) project, PRs
should:
* be from a forked project with a relevant branch name
* be narrowly focused with no more than 3 or 4 logical commits
* when possible, address only one issue
* refer to any related issues by issue number

## Commit messages

The
[PhoneGap](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/wiki/Git-Commit-Message-Format)
project has a good set of guidelines we also use:

* First line should be maximum 50 characters long
* It should summarise the change and use imperative present tense
* The rest of the commit message should come after a blank line
* We encourage you to use Markdown syntax in the rest of the commit
message
* Preferably keep to an 72 character limit on lines in the rest of the
message.

If a commit is related to a particular issue, put the issue number
after a hash (#) somewhere in the detail. You can put the issue number
in the first line summary, but only if you can also fit in a useful
summary of what was changed in the commit.

Here's an example commit message:

```
No more autorent charges

Although by default the codebase compiles with `-DNEW_RENT`, which
sets the normal rent price to 0 gold/day, as indicated by `offer`,
players were getting charged more than zero coins when they rejoined
the game. This addresses issue #17.
